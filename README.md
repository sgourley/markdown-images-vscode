# Markdown Images

Show images in markdown preview from a photo library.

This is early-stage software and probably _not_ the add-in you are looking for...

## Usage

Reference your images with an exclamation mark prefix, as below. This prefix will be replaced with the photo library url when displayed in the markdown preview window.

```markdown
![](!path/to/image.jpeg)
```

## Configuration

The url to a photo library is configurable with the `markdown.images.library.url` setting.
